  -- Since we need to keep the entities list sorted, we remove "dead"

  -- function we merge the entries with the active entries list and sort it.

  -- The rationale for this is to decouple the entities scan/iteration and
  -- the addition. For example, it could happen that during an iteration we
  -- add new entities; however we cannot modify the active entities list
  -- content while we iterate.

  -- We are using the "table" namespace functions since we are continously
  -- scambling the content by reordering it.
